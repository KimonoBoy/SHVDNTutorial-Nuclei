# SHVDNTutorial-Nuclei
A successor to **NucleiLite** - this will build upon everything we learned here [NucleiLite - Wiki](https://github.com/KimonoBoy/SHVDNTutorial-NucleiLite/wiki)  

The idea of this **mod** is to **create** a **well-build**, **well-documented** overall **mod menu**, to **help** people interested in **developing mods** for **Grand Theft Auto V**

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/KimonoBoy/SHVDN-Tutorial/wiki)

## Note
Both the **Wiki** and the **Mod** itself is a work in progress and it's in a very early stage.
