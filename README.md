# SHVDN-Tutorial
A Grand Theft Auto V step-by-step guide on developing a mod menu using ScriptHookVDotNet 

The idea of this mod is to create a well-build, well-documented overall mod menu, to help people interested in developing mods for **Grand Theft Auto V**

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/KimonoBoy/SHVDN-Tutorial/wiki)

## Note
Both the **Wiki** and the **Mod** itself is a work in progress and it's in a very early stage.
