# SHVDNTutorial-Nuclei
A successor to **NucleiLite** - this will build upon everything we learned here [NucleiLite - Wiki](https://github.com/KimonoBoy/SHVDNTutorial-NucleiLite/wiki)  

The idea of this **mod** is to **create** a **well-build**, **well-documented** overall **mod menu**, to **help** people interested in **developing mods** for **Grand Theft Auto V**

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/KimonoBoy/SHVDN-Tutorial/wiki)

## NOTE
I'm in an optimization Process with the mod itself. Don't worry every step up until this point will be covered, but the mod itself needs to go through a huge Refactor process first.
All these updates and changes atm is for my own personal test-stage, rethinking how the different layers should interact to make the most sense, and single-ton instances are a challenge to test, scale
and maintain - unfortunately deriving from the Script class doesn't allow for dependency injection, and state-management between different layers can be a tedious and cumbersome subject.

However, when I begin updating the wiki again, you should be able to catch up with all the changes made this far, but I'd rather make it right first than teach you something that is subject to change.

Both the **Wiki** and the **Mod** itself is a work in progress and it's in a very early stage.
